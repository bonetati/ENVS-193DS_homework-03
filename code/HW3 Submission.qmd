I could calculate the mean stress level for each day of the week to understand if certain days are more stressful. This is informative because I suspect that weekdays, especially Mondays, are more stressful due to academic or work responsibilities, while weekends are probably less stressful.

```{r 1b}

ggplot(personal_data, aes(x = 
  factor(
    Day_of_Week,
      levels = c("Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")), y = Stress_Level, fill = Day_of_Week)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "col", alpha = 0.6, color = "black") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Stress Level by Day of the Week",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Stress Level"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Figure 1. This figure shows the distribution and mean of my self reported stress levels by day of the week. Bars represent the average stress level for each day, while points show individual daily reports.

```{r 1d}
personal_data %>%
  group_by(Day_of_Week) %>%
  summarize(`Average Stress Level` = round(mean(Stress_Level, na.rm = TRUE), 1)) %>%
  rename(`Day of Week` = Day_of_Week) %>%
  arrange(factor(`Day of Week`, levels = c("Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Average Stress Level by Day of the Week",
  )
```

For my affective visualization I want to combine both art and R. Through learning about different ggplots I want to use the radial plot to look like a flower representing the week. Each size/shape of the petal refers to the amount of stress on average. With this then I hope to overlay pngs of water colors onto the radial plot to represent the feeling and stress of each day.

chunk_sizes <- c(1.7, 2.2, 3.6, 5.2, 3.0, 4.6, 2.7)

stress_data <- tibble(
  day = chunk_order, #Order of chunks
  stress = c(7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), #height of chunks
  width = chunk_sizes #width of chunks
) %>%
  mutate(day = factor(day, levels = chunk_order))

# Base radial plot

  geom_col(color = NA) +

  theme_void() + #Gets rid of text
  theme(legend.position = "none")

#Radial plots repeated with different coord_polar
p2 <- ggplot(stress_data, aes(x = day, y = stress, width = width, fill = stress)) +
  geom_col(color = NA) +
